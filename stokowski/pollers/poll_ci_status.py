"""
Poll Linear tickets in `Awaiting CI` and reflect CI + reviewer status back.

For each ticket in the configured project's `Awaiting CI` state:
  1. Find the linked symphony PR (matches the ticket's identifier in title/body/branch).
  2. Read PR CI status from the consolidated GraphQL fetch.
  3. Read PR comments for the AI reviewer's `REVIEW_VERDICT: APPROVE|REQUEST_CHANGES`
     line, unless reviewer is skipped for this ticket.
  4. Decide:
       - CI green AND (reviewer APPROVE or skipped)  -> Gate Approved
       - CI red OR reviewer REQUEST_CHANGES          -> Rework (with comment)
       - CI never fired (OPEN+mergeable, zero check
         runs) past the grace window                 -> re-trigger CI via an
                                                        empty commit, capped
                                                        at 3 attempts, then
                                                        fall back to Rework
       - Anything still pending                      -> leave alone, retry next tick

Reviewer is skipped when:
  - The Linear ticket has the `skip-review` label.
  - The PR title contains `[skip-review]` (also makes the reviewer workflow itself skip).

Idempotent: safe to run on a timer. The Rework comment uses a marker to avoid
duplicate notifications.

GraphQL load (post 2026-05-11 refactor)
---------------------------------------
This tick issues exactly **one** `gh api graphql` call against GitHub —
``fetch_symphony_pr_full`` in ``_pr_helpers.py``. That call returns every
open + closed symphony PR with checks, commit date, and comments embedded.
Prior to the refactor, each Awaiting-CI ticket required ~2 separate `gh`
GraphQL calls per tick (`gh pr checks` + `gh pr view --json comments`),
plus 1 list call and 1 REST commit-date call. At ~10 tickets, that
exhausted the 5,000/hr GraphQL budget and the script crashed mid-loop,
stranding tickets (SYN-1039 / SYN-924 / SYN-919 / SYN-948 / SYN-955).

If the fetch fails (rate limit, transient gh error), the tick exits
gracefully with a warning — no tickets transitioned, the next tick retries.

Env:
  LINEAR_API_KEY              required
  GH_TOKEN or `gh auth status` already authed
  REPO                        optional, defaults to SyncedTech/synced-sport
  PROJECT_ID                  optional, Linear project to poll (defaults to CMBA Trial)
  STOKOWSKI_URL               optional, URL of the Stokowski dashboard API
  LINEAR_TEAM_ID              optional, team owning workflow labels
  LINEAR_STATE_IN_PROGRESS    optional, Linear state ID for In Progress
  LINEAR_STATE_AWAITING_CI    optional, Linear state ID for Awaiting CI
  LINEAR_STATE_GATE_APPROVED  optional, Linear state ID for Gate Approved
  LINEAR_STATE_REWORK         optional, Linear state ID for Rework
  LINEAR_STATE_DONE           optional, Linear state ID for Done
  LINEAR_STATE_CANCELED       optional, Linear state ID for Canceled

      1. POST git/commits  — create an empty commit (same tree as HEAD,

      2. PATCH git/refs/heads/<branch> — fast-forward the PR branch to it.

    The empty commit changes no files (identical tree), so the PR diff is
    unaffected; only a fresh `synchronize` event is emitted. `workflow_dispatch`
    was rejected as an alternative because a manually-dispatched run executes
    against the branch ref, not in PR context, so its checks would NOT attach
    to the PR — leaving the "zero check runs" condition unchanged. A PR
    close+reopen was rejected because `ci.yml` does not list `reopened`.

    Requires only the `repo` token scope (verified: the orchestration token
    has `repo` + `workflow`). Returns the new commit SHA on success, or

       server-side rebase, runner was disk-full and never claimed the job,

       ``CI_RETRIGGER_MAX_ATTEMPTS`` per PR (counted via marker comments).
       Re-triggered tickets stay in Awaiting CI — the next tick sees the

       bounce to Rework so the agent re-pushes fresh.

    Idempotency: the Rework marker includes the PR's 12-char HEAD SHA prefix,
